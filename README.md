## by (Ahmed Muhammed)


## Dataset

> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the TMDb Movie Dataset, i can now come to the decision that:

> 2014 has the highest number of movies released with over 700 movies.
>The budget for 1997-2005 was very high compared to others.
>Drama is the most popular genre, following by comedy, action, horror and adventure.


## Limitation

During the data cleaning process, I split the genre column seperated it by '|' for easy parsing during the exploration phase. This increases the time taken in calculating the result.
